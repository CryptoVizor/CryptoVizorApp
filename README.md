<p align="center"><b>CryptoVizor</b> is an app that can show NFT in AR.</p>

<p align="center">The app is iOS only for now because we only use ARKit with unity but if you wanna add ARCore support you can open a pull request.</p>

The app is also available on AppStore for free.

There is a significant difference between GitHub and AppStore version, it is the ability to take pics.  
Because we use a paid plugin for the AppStore version we don't upload it to Github. We will update this part to use an open-source library later.
